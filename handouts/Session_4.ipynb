    "### 2.1 Basic Aspects of CLTS\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sound Classes in CLTS\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to link graphemes in transcription systems and transcription datasets to feature\n",
    "bundles, it is useful to distinguish rudimentary classes of sounds. We distinguish three\n",
    "basic sound classes (consonants, vowels, and tones), a specific class of markers (to indicate\n",
    "syllable or morpheme breaks or word boundaries) and two derived classes (consonant\n",
    "clusters and diphthongs). As of the moment, we do not allow for triphthongs and clusters of\n",
    "more than two consonants (although they could be added at a later stage), in order to keep\n",
    "the system manageable. Clicks are represented as a specific type of consonant that has\n",
    "click or nasal-click as its manner. The representation of tones as a sound class of itself is\n",
    "necessitated by the fact that many phonetic descriptions of tone languages (especially in\n",
    "South-East-Asian languages) represent tone separately. It is further justified by phonological\n",
    "theory, given that tones in many languages may change independently, often correlated with\n",
    "factors that cannot be tied to a segmental context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex sound classes in CLTS are not explicitly defined, but instead automatically\n",
    "derived by identifying the basic graphemes of which they consist. Diphthongs are thus\n",
    "defined by two vowels, and the grapheme ‹oe›, for example, is treated as a diphthong\n",
    "consisting of a rounded close-mid back and an unrounded close-mid front vowel. In a similar\n",
    "way, we allow complex consonant clusters to be defined in order to transcribe, for example,\n",
    "doubly articulated consonants or clicks containing a pulmonic release (see Table 1 for\n",
    "examples).\n",

    "#### Feature Bundles as Comparative Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to ensure that we can compare sounds across different transcription systems and datasets, a feature system that can be used to model sounds as feature bundles, serving as comparative concept in the sense of [Haspelmath (2010)](:bib:Haspelmath2010) is indispensable. We therefore propose specific feature systems for each of our three sound classes (consonant, vowel, tone), which allow us to identify a large number of different sounds across transcription systems and transcription datasets. The features themselves can be roughly divided into obligatory features (like manner, place, and phonation in consonants, and roundedness, height, and centrality in vowels), and optional features (usually binary, i.e., present or absent, such as duration, nasalization, aspiration). Our current feature system contains 23 consonant features, 23 vowel features and 4 tonal features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our choice of features derives from the graphemic representation of sounds in the system of the IPA. It is practically oriented and does not claim to represent any deeper truth about distinctive features in phonology. Instead we focus on being able to align the features as easily as possible with a given graphemic representation of a particular sound in a transcription system. As a result, some features may appear awkward and even naïve, from a phonological perspective. For example, instead of distinguishing ejectives from plain consonants by manner only (contrasting “ejective stops” and “plain stops”), we code ejectivity as an additional feature with a binary value (present or absent). In a similar way, we do not distinguish between different kinds of phonation (voiced, breathy-voiced, creaky-voiced, etc.) but code separately for breathiness, creakiness, and phonation (voiced or voiceless). The advantage of this coding practice is that we can easily infer sounds that we have not yet listed in our database based on the combination of base graphemes and diacritics. In addition, we can also avoid discussions in those cases where linguists often agree. If we explicitly treated the diacritic ‹ʱ› in the IPA transcription system as indicating breathiness and implying voiced phonation, we would have problem in distinguishing the admittedly rare instances where scholars explicitly transcribe voiceless stops with breathy release using a voiceless stop in combination with the diacritic for breathy voice (‹pʱ›, ‹tʱ›, ‹kʱ›, etc.) in order to indicate a voiceless initial with (breathy) voiced aspiration.\n",

    "#### Transcription Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "A transcription system is understood as a generative entity in CLTS, being able to create sounds that were not produced explicitly before (although the ultimate productivity of a transcription system is, of course, limited). Transcription systems are defined by providing graphemes for the basic sound classes (consonants, vowels, tones) which are explicitly defined and linked to our feature system. Additionally, diacritics can be defined and may precede or follow the base graphemes, adding one additional feature per symbol to the base grapheme, depending on their position and the sound class of the base grapheme. In the IPA system, for example, the diacritic ‹ʰ› can only be attached to consonants, but it will evoke different feature values when preceding ‹ʰt› (pre-aspirated voiceless alveolar stop consonant) or following ‹tʰ› (aspirated voiceless alveolar stop consonant) the base grapheme ‹t›.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transcription systems can furthermore specify aliases, both for base graphemes and for diacritics. The IPA, for example, allows to indicate breathiness by two diacritics, the ‹dʱ› which we mentioned above, and the ‹◌̤›, which is placed under the base grapheme. In the CLTS framework, both glyphs can be parsed, and both ‹dʱ› and ‹d̤› would be interpreted as a breathy voiced alveolar stop, but ‹dʱ› would be treated as the regular grapheme representation and ‹d̤› as its alias. Another important example for aliases are affricates like the voiceless alveolar affricate which can be rendered as either a single symbol ‹ʦ› (Unicode 02A6) or two symbols ‹ts› (Unicode 0074 u. 0073, the preferred version in CLTS).1 In these and many other cases, the CLTS framework correctly recognizes the sounds denoted by the graphemes while at the same time proposing a default representation of ambiguous graphemes in a given transcription system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transcription Data\n",
    "\n",
    "CLTS currently links 15 different transcription datasets, summarized in Table 2. The datasets were selected for different reasons. We tried to assemble as many of the cross-linguistic sound inventory datasets as possible, since apart from the comparison of Phoible with Ruhlen’s database by Dediu and Moisik (2016), these existing databsets have not yet been thoroughly compared. Given the large number of sound segments which one can find in these datasets (most of them representing a supposedly strict version of IPA), they provide a useful way to test how well our framework recognizes sounds written in IPA which were not explicitly defined.\n",

    "### 2.2 Technical Aspects of CLTS\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parsing and Generating Sounds\n",
    "\n",
    "CLTS employs a sophisticated algorithm for the parsing and generation of graphemes for a given transcription system. The parsing algorithm employs a three-step procedure, consisting of (A) normalization, (B) direct lookup, and (C) generation of graphemes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In (A), all sounds are generally normalized, following Unicode’s NFD normalization in which diacritics and base graphemes are maximally dissolved ([Moran and Cysouw 2017: 16](:bib:Moran2017)). \n",
    "In addition the algorithm uses normalization tables of homoglyphs which can easily be confused specific to each transcription system. The normalization applies to single glyphs only and employs a simple lookup table in which source and target glyph are defined. In this way, one can easily prevent users from using the wrong character to represent, for example, the schwa-sound [ə], since the data is normalized beforehand. Table 3 gives a small list of examples for base graphemes normalized in CLTS.\n",
    "The following table gives examples for typical confusables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Source | Code | Target  | Code | Sound Name\n",
    "--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\n",
    "λ | 03BB | ʎ | 028E | palatalized alveolar lateral approximant consonant\n",
    "ǝ | 01DD | ə | 0259 | unrounded mid central vowel\n",
    "ɂ     | 0242 | ʔ | 0294 | voiceless glottal stop consonant\n",
    "ε | 03B5 |  ɛ | 025B | unrounded open-mid front\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In (B), the algorithm searches for direct matches of the grapheme with the base graphemes provided along with the transcription system. If a grapheme can be matched directly, the algorithm checks whether it is flagged as an alias and provides the corrected grapheme. If the grapheme could not be resolved in (A), the algorithm tries to generate it in (C), by first using a regular expression to identify whether the unknown grapheme contains a known base grapheme. If this is the case, the algorithm searches to the left and the right of the base grapheme for known diacritics, looks up the features from the table of diacritic features, and then combines the features of the base grapheme with the new features supplied by the diacritics to a generated sound. The algorithm returns an unknown sound if either no base grapheme can be identified or if one of the diacritics cannot be interpreted correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm can be used in a reverse fashion by supplying a feature bundle from which the algorithm will then try to infer the underlying grapheme in a given transcription system. Here again, we can distinguish between sounds which were already defined as base graphemes of the transcription system, and sounds which are generated by identifying a base sound and then converting the remaining features to diacritic symbols. Since the order of features serving as diacritics is defined directly, the algorithm explicitly normalizes phonetic transcriptions in those cases where features are supplied in the wrong order. For example, if a transcription system provides the labialized aspirated voiceless velar stop consonant as ‹kʰʷ› (as, for example, APiCS), the algorithm will normalize the order of diacritics to ‹kʷʰ› and flag the grapheme as an alias.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following table gives an example on the parsing algorithm currently used by CLTS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input | Normalized | Alias | Base | BIPA | Name\n",

    "tːˢʰ | - | - | t | ? | unknown sound (‹ˢ› is not defined as a diacritic)\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Python API and Online Database\n",
    "\n",
    "CLTS comes with a Python API which can be used from the command line or within Python scripts and offers a convenient way to test the framework both on large datasets and on an ad-hoc basis. It comes along with a brief tutorial introducing the main aspects of the code as well as a “cookbook” containing a series of coding recipes to address specific tasks. The data is further presented online in the form of a database in the well-known Cross-Linguistically Linked Data framework (http://clld.org, [Haspelmath and Forkel 2015](:bib:Haspelmath2015)) which provides interested users with the common look-and-feel of popular CLLD datasets such as Glottolog or WALS. \n",
