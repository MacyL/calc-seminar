    "Many structures we are dealing with – be it in daily life or in science – can\n",
    "be represented as sequences. The bird songs which awake us in the morning\n",

    "When dealing with sequences, we need to keep some general questions in mind, which are crucial for an understanding of sequences. For example, not all sequences are discrete, but many sequences in our real life are continuous. If we pronounce a word, or listen to a piece of music, it is not always straightforward to *segment* the sequence we perceive into distinct units. Instead, we have too deal with continuous entities, and we use the process of *segmentation* as a model-theoretic idealization that facilitates our research. We should however, not forget, that all segmentation is in fact an idealization.\n",
