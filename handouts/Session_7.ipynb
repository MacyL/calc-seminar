For example, not all sequences are discrete, but many sequences in our real life are continuous. If we pronounce a word, or listen to a piece of music, it is not always straightforward to *segment* the sequence we perceive into distinct units. Instead, we have too deal with continuous entities, and we use the process of *segmentation* as a model-theoretic idealization that facilitates our research. We should however, not forget, that all segmentation is in fact an idealization.\n",

    "historical linguists in creating, editing,\n",
    "analysing, and publishing etymological\n",
    "datasets. The EDICTOR offers interactive solutions for important tasks in historical linguistics, including facilitated input\n",
    "and segmentation of phonetic transcriptions, quantitative and qualitative analyses\n",
    "of phonetic and morphological data, enhanced interfaces for cognate class assignment and multiple word alignment, and\n",

    "#### 3.2.1 Preparing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Our input file for EDICTOR is the file we also used for the alignments. If you want to prepare data to be used from within EDICTOR. What is important is that the first row of the test file lists the ID of the words, and that there are at least two further columns, one with a CONCEPT and one with a DOCULECT. EDICTOR theoretically accepts other column names, but don't mess with them, as the behavior may be unexpected. What is also needed is a column with TOKENS (segmentized IPA entries) that list the translation for each item. For alignments, we further need a COGID column (we will discuss cognate coding in detail in Session 8), and a (potentially) empty column for the ALIGNMENT. If ALIGNMENT is not yet there in the data, EDICTOR will automatically create it, if you align strings manually. But we recommend to always start from a file that has all those columns already. EDICTOR will add values in the cell, but should not manipulate the columns.\n",

    "#### 3.2.2 Loading Data into EDICTOR\n",
    "\n",
    "Loading data into EDICTOR is straightforward, either per drag-and-drop, or by pressing the select button. The file should be a plain text file, no Excel or similar. In order to create such a file from Excel, just open an empty text file on your computer, mark all cells in your Excel spreadsheet (make sure you added all column names and don't have empty rows in your data), copy them, and paste them in the text file. \n",

    "#### 3.2.3 Aligning Data with EDICTOR\n",
    "\n",
    "Aligning data is straightforward. By clicking on cells of the column COGID with the right mouse button, you can select a given cognate set to be aligned. A pop-up opens showing the (usually initially unaligned) alignment. By clicking either on EDIT or on ALIGN, the alignment can be actively edited by the user. EDIT won't change the initial alignment, but ALIGN will use a very simple base-line algorithm for multiple alignment to pre-align the data. Once you entered the EDIT mode, you can push and pull the sounds and arrange them in a very simple manner: pressing on a sound will insert a gap symbol before that sound, so push it to the right. Pressing on a gap will delete that gap. You can further mark parts that are considered as \"unalignable\" and could be ignored."

    "#### 3.2.4 Saving data with EDICTOR\n",
    "\n",
    "Saving is a bit less intuitive at the moment. You actually need to \"download\" your data. You need to first press the SAVE button on the top right corner (shortcut on non-mac systems: CONTROL + S), and then press the EXPORT button next to it, to do what looks like a download of the data, but is in fact only a way to transfer data in a save way from the sandbox of the webbrowser to your computer. EDICTOR will add some more text at the end of your original file, to make sure it remembers your previous settings. These lines can be safely deleted, if you prefer. EDICTOR will re-open the file without problems, but not have remembered, for example, what concepts you were working on, or different specific settings."
