    "To make sure that your data is comparable in terms of the concepts that you investigated, you should link your questionnaire to the Concepticon ([List et al. 2016](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=List2016a)). Many scholars still have a huge problem in understanding what the Concepticon actually is. We won't go into the details here, but if you are interested in selecting comparable questionnaires (e.g., words less prone to borrowing) for your language sample, you should definitely have a close look at the Concepticon website at http://concepticon.clld.org, since it is highly likely that your specific questionnaire has already been linked. In this case, you should download the concept list in the form in which it is provided by the Concepticon project, as this will spare you the time of typing it off yourself (which may introduce new errors), and you will get a lot of meta-information which may be useful. For example, if you download the Leipzig-Jakarta list ([Tadmor 2009](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Tadmor2009), [Tadmor-2009-100](http://concepticon.clld.org/contributions/Tadmor-2009-100)), you may first learn a lot about how it was constructed, but you can also directly compare it with lists that may be similar. If you want to know how stable the concepts in this list are, for example, you could have a look at the basic list underlying the original project ([Haspelmath-2009-1460](http://concepticon.clld.org/contributions/Haspelmath-2009-1460)), where you will receive explicit ranks for all concepts.\n",

The command is a simple as typing ```concepticon map_concepts <yourconceptlist>``` in your terminal, where you replace ```<yourconceptlist>``` with your filename.

This allows you to conveniently jump from block to block in order to select the best match (or manually add a better match).

This algorithm essentially divides a \"gloss\" (a concept label) into different parts, and also tries to determine information regarding part of speech and the like. This algorithm is currently being revised, and we hope to be able to provide information soon.</span>\n",

    "The Concepticon is a collaborative effort that is supposed to render our linguistic data more comparable. The more questionnaires we can add to our collection, the easier it will be for future research to build on these resources. Even if you think that you do not need to link your data to Concepticon, since you anyway use the \"standard list\" by Swadesh, you should at least provide a ```concepts.tsv``` file in which you list your explicit links. In this way you guarantee that other can re-use your data and also contribute to the collaborative efforts which are currently being done in the context of the CLDF initiative."
