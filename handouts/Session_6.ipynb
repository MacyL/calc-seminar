    "In order to annotate linguistic data, scholars often make use of ad-hoc formats based on spreadsheet software (Excel, LibreOffice, GoogleSheets). The most common format, of which many linguists also claim that it is the most universal and most easy-to-understand one, is the one according to which rows represent concepts and columns represent languages. This format essentially reserves one column for one language in the spreadsheet, and one row for one concept. The language names are given in the first row, and the concept labels are given in the first column of the spreadsheet.\n",

    "In the previous sections we have tried to show that the ad-hoc formats employed by linguists for data collection usually have huge disadvantages in terms of transparancy and inter-operability, and we recommend all users to take the time to read more about the formats underlying LingPy, EDICTOR, but also the *Cross-Linguistic Data Formats* initiative ([Forkel et al. 2017](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Forkel2017a), see http://cldf.clld.org). These formats are to a large degree compatible, for LingPy and EDICTOR, they are almost identical, and will be introduced below. \n",

    "The most obvious failure in data annotation that many scholars commit when preparing their data in Excel or other spreadsheet software is that they include multiple different types of information into one cell. Thus, if a word has a variant, scholars will place it into one cell in their spreadsheet software and separate the entries by a comma, a colon, a tilde, a dash, or at times even by a back-slash, often even using all of these separators inconsistently for the same dataset. A first and general rule that people creating data must understand and follow, is that \n",
    "\n",
    "  **`1.` Only one type of information should be put into one cell in a spreadsheet.** \n",
    "\n",
    "This rule is non-negotiable, as in our experience with a huge number of differently coded datasets, scholars necessarily make annotation errors, even if they try to be consistent. Computers are not like humans, and if you want to profit from computers to ease your work, assume that they cannot interpret whether you use a comma and a colon without semantic difference when listing word variants or whether you do it on purpose. In fact, humans are also unlikely to understand this, unless it was them who created the data. \n",

    "A more general rule deriving from this first rule is the rule that \n",
    "\n",
    "  **`2.` All information valid for a given analysis needs to be consistently annotated.**\n",

    "This means, for example, that, if root alternation is important for your reconstruction and cognate decisions, you need to think how to model this in consistent markup. If your data contains reflexes of an alternating protoform `*`*ka-* vs. `*`*ku-*, for example, it is not sufficient to simply write ```*ka- ~ *ku-``` and listing the reflexes, assuming that your readers will understand which reflex stems from which of the two alternants. Instead, Two proto-forms should be listed, the variants should be assigned to the correct proto-form from which they evolve, and the additional information should be given that `*`*ka-* and `*`*ku-* are variants of the same root. This practice is rarely followed systematically in etymological dictionaries, and therefore also often disregarded in databases, but it is clear that it is the only way to transparently list what reflex stems from which proto-variant. In fact, this is not a matter of a more computational approach to historical linguistics, but rather a matter of improving on our common practice in historical linguistics, which has for too long a time been based on lax guidelines."
