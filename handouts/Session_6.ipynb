    "In order to annotate linguistic data, scholars often make use of ad-hoc formats based on spreadsheet software (Excel, LibreOffice, GoogleSheets). The most common format, of which many linguists also claim that it is the most universal and most easy-to-understand one, is the one according to which rows represent concepts and columns represent languages. This format essentially reserves one column for one language in the spreadsheet, and one row for one concept. The language names are given in the first row, and the concept labels are given in the first column of the spreadsheet.\n",

    "In the previous sections we have tried to show that the ad-hoc formats employed by linguists for data collection usually have huge disadvantages in terms of transparancy and inter-operability, and we recommend all users to take the time to read more about the formats underlying LingPy, EDICTOR, but also the *Cross-Linguistic Data Formats* initiative ([Forkel et al. 2017](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Forkel2017a), see http://cldf.clld.org). These formats are to a large degree compatible, for LingPy and EDICTOR, they are almost identical, and will be introduced below. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most obvious failure in data annotation that many scholars commit when preparing their data in Excel or other spreadsheet software is that they include multiple different types of information into one cell. Thus, if a word has a variant, scholars will place it into one cell in their spreadsheet software and separate the entries by a comma, a colon, a tilde, a dash, or at times even by a back-slash, often even using all of these separators inconsistently for the same dataset. A first and general rule that people creating data must understand and follow, is that \n",
    "\n",
    "  **`1.` Only one type of information should be put into one cell in a spreadsheet.** \n",
    "\n",
    "This rule is non-negotiable, as in our experience with a huge number of differently coded datasets, scholars necessarily make annotation errors, even if they try to be consistent. Computers are not like humans, and if you want to profit from computers to ease your work, assume that they cannot interpret whether you use a comma and a colon without semantic difference when listing word variants or whether you do it on purpose. In fact, humans are also unlikely to understand this, unless it was them who created the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "A more general rule deriving from this first rule is the rule that \n",
    "\n",
    "  **`2.` All information valid for a given analysis needs to be consistently annotated.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This means, for example, that, if root alternation is important for your reconstruction and cognate decisions, you need to think how to model this in consistent markup. If your data contains reflexes of an alternating protoform `*`*ka-* vs. `*`*ku-*, for example, it is not sufficient to simply write ```*ka- ~ *ku-``` and listing the reflexes, assuming that your readers will understand which reflex stems from which of the two alternants. Instead, Two proto-forms should be listed, the variants should be assigned to the correct proto-form from which they evolve, and the additional information should be given that `*`*ka-* and `*`*ku-* are variants of the same root. This practice is rarely followed systematically in etymological dictionaries, and therefore also often disregarded in databases, but it is clear that it is the only way to transparently list what reflex stems from which proto-variant. In fact, this is not a matter of a more computational approach to historical linguistics, but rather a matter of improving on our common practice in historical linguistics, which has for too long a time been based on lax guidelines."

    "Orthographic Profiles provide an easy method of replacing letters and letter combinations with the corresponding IPA-symbols by using a simple replacement table. They work like Finite State Automata: They look at each letter of the data from left to right, check whether it is in the replacement table, and replace it with the corresponding IPA. They also take letter combinations into account, and therefore they go through the table from the longest to the shortest entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if you would want to convert a few Castilian Spanish words into a fairly phonemic IPA rendering:\n",
    "\n",
    "*hola llamar amiga*\n",

    "\n",
    "So far this sounds pretty easy. There however are some caveats.\n",

    "Orthographic Profiles need to be prepared individually not only for each language but also for each transcription system.\n",
    "\n",
    "They work well if there is a 1 to 1 correspondence between grapheme and sound. But they are a bit tedious to create if the pronunciation depends on the surrounding letters as that can easily turn into a long list of letter combinations you need to include.\n",
    "\n",
    "One easy example for this was the &lt;ll> above, here is another one: In Spanish, the letter c gets pronounced differently depending on the letter afterwards. Normally it's /k/, but before high vowels it's /θ/ (depending on the dialect). Therefore you need to add the following rows to account for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Grapheme | IPA  |\n",
    "|----------|------|\n",
    "| c        | k    |\n",
    "| ci       | θi    |\n",
    "| ce       | θe    |\n",
    "\n",
    "Spanish orthography being as regular as it is, making a full Orthographic Profile for it wouldn't be too difficult a task (at least for a phonemic rendering of standard dialects). But in other orthographic systems, if there are irregular exceptions to the pronunciation you then need to list each of those individually. For example an Orthographic Profile for English would be nearly impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, Orthographic Profiles are not capable of handling things that are not visible in the orthography (which often includes accent, morpheme borders, tone,...), and therefore also not pronunciation differences that depend on this information. If you have data depending on things like that you first need to add this kind of information to the input (often manually).\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g. if you have some German input in standard orthography you would need to first mark the morpheme borders (e.g. with .) and, especially, also mark the vowel length in some fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise your computer wouldn't be able to tell that there is a glottal stop before the second &lt;a> in *Hausarzt* but not in *Bausatz*. Nor would it be able to figure out that the &lt;a> in *Tat* is long but the &lt;a> in *hat* is short.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the usefulness of the method of Orthographic Profiles hugely depends on what kind of data you are dealing with, and also how exact the IPA needs to be, but can be very helpful in a lot of contexts. It basically depends on whether it's more effort to create the Orthographic Profile or to transliterate all the linguistic data manually."
